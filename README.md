# Health Insurance Lead Prediction - Classification Model

## Description
The Health Insurance Lead Prediction - Classification Model project involved developing a predictive model for an insurance company to forecast potential customer conversion. Using a dataset of user interactions and conversion outcomes, various classification algorithms including KNN, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and AdaBoost were implemented. Cross-validated evaluation scores were compared, and the best-performing model was selected for deployment.

## Skills/Tools Used
- Python (Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy)
- Classification Modeling
- Supervised Learning
- Model Evaluation
- Jupyter Notebooks

## Results
- Implemented and evaluated multiple classification algorithms for predictive modeling.
- Enhanced the company's ability to target potential customers more effectively.
- Contributed to the optimization of marketing efforts and resource allocation.

## Future Improvements
- Explore ensemble methods and feature engineering techniques for further model improvement.
- Conduct additional analysis to identify potential factors influencing lead conversion.
